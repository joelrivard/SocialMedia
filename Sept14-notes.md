## Scolari article on Media Evolution

In this article, the author talks about the evolution of media and looks at the emergence, dominance and survival/extinction in the media ecology.

Where is the author coming from?

  1) Communications background - article published in the Communications Journal
  2) He doesn't want to look at a linear relationships, but rather non-linear, which includes network relationships

  The author first talks about media archaeology and media history and how media evolution doesn't quite fit in with these area of studies.

  The author goes on to compare the natural life cycle of new media evolution with media evolution and establishes the 3 sections of media evolution: emergence, dominance, survival/extinction. In all three of these, the author explains the

  Plans | Emergence | Dominance | Survival/extinction |
  --- | --- | --- | --- |
  Technological Devices | New medium is created from a combination of a series of technological devices. | Medium are able to impose their own dynamics on the rest | innovation can lead to new life to a new medium / new technology can lead to extinction of another medium
  Production | Unknown new media and users don't know how it works or how to benefit from it. | Production is industrialized and is mature for mass production | Introduce changes to the production methods / leave behind professional profiles
  Textual Content | Creators don't know how to produce specific content for this new medium | The medium finds its own language | Adapt and renovate its narrative (ex. Hypertelevision) or become extinct
  Reception | Receivers don't quit yet know about the new medium...they are typically exposed to it from the old mediums (radio to tv) | reception is naturalized and is culturally accepted practice. People know how to interact with the medium | Number of users declines as they consume other medium. Medium may also have a niche of users (ex. vinyl records)

  The author looks at the ** simulation ** through the 3 stages. In ** Emergence ** ,  there is a mimicking process from old medium for the new medium to enter into the dominance stage. The example is the one of radio stories in Spain. At first, they were reproductions of plays on radios, but then it later evolved into its own form.

In ** Survival ** , the author brings up the example of Hypertelevision and how that format has survived by updating itself with the rise of the new interactive media that is the world wide web.

Conclusions:

The evolution of each medium does not travel along a separate track; rather, it is in constant interaction with the evolution of other media.

Media have close relationships with one another.
