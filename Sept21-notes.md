## Canadian Research Libraries - Social Media presentation

This presentation is dated in 2011 and is interesting to see what ~400 respondents are saying about social media use at that time.

This presentation goes through the survey and shows the results of the survey along with comments.

People at this time seem to focus their social media presence on blogs, wikis, a bit of Facebook, rss feeds, videos, online chat such as Meebo and a bit of twitter.

Sharing of anything at this time is rather low too. web-file sharing, picture sharing, social bookmarking, social cataloguing etc.

Use of Google Docs and Dropbox to collaborate on working documents

Are social media tools useful for work, do you think they'll be adopted at work?
Most have a resounding yes that they would.

Lots of messages about cloud computing and people worried about privacy and information being on USA servers.

More people in the library should get involved with social media and not just one person should do it.

It doesn't seem to be a huge priority for management to add social media in training or IT support.

Some library staff don't use social media since faculty aren't using it. Some are saying that they're using social media to connect with students.

## 5 Trends for Social Media in 2016
By Ryan Holmes - Hootsuite

1. Social Networks enter the workforce - Slack
2. Companies turn to employees for amplification - employees tweeting from their personal accounts
3. Companies wade into social messaging - this remains an untapped resource as people don't seem to be really using it for work yet. All social media applications have them.
4. More social media advertising - even more precise and taylored for each user.
5. More video capabilities to social network sites - expensive for companies to create professional videos, so they are starting to:

  - Crowdsource videos
  - Make videos shorter (Vine)
  - Use periscope or meerkat to broadcast
